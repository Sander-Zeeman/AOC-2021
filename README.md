# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 event! (![https://adventofcode.com/])

This year, I took on the self-imposed challenge of only using Haskell!

The code I write will not be modified after developing the initial solution.
Therefore, the quality of the Haskell code I write should hopefully improve near the end of this event.
